### Hair Detection App

- To run the GUI, use the following file:  
  **`hair-detection/main/app.py`**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
This app currently uses an **older version of the trained model**, so predictions may not be highly accurate.  
The **newer and more accurate model** has a large file size and cannot be pushed to GitHub.
